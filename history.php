  		<p>My name is Nicholas Gilson, and I believe John Lennon said it best when he wrote, “Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans.</p>
  		
  		<p>At the age of 14, my father was moved against his will from New Zealand to America in the hull of a steamship.  His father had died years earlier, and his mother (my grandmother) had remarried an American Navy man.</p>
  		
  		<p>Having been relocated to the landlocked state of Pennsylvania, my father longed to stay connected to his Kiwi roots, and in large part, that meant staying connected to sailing.  He had built his first sailboat from a broom, sheet, and tire when he was five years old.  My grandmother can be seen in an old photograph calmly watching her child venture out into the deep waters of Evans Bay in a small boat he had created.  New Zealanders are the antithesis of the helicopter parent.</p>
  		
  		<p>Now in America, my 14-year-old father started crafting his next boat, a project that would span generations.</p>

  		<p>In 2001, some 40 years later, I was turning 13, and with the benefit of my father’s basement workshop, I too had developed a love for building and design.  My Dad told me that when he was my age he had started to build a Paper Tiger, an iconic and ultralight wooden sailboat of New Zealand design.</p>
  		<p class="collapse" id="block-id1">This explained the two large and unfinished boat hulls in the basement of my family’s home in Rhode Island; they had been there for as long as I could remember.<br><br>
  		In 2001, my father had an idea rooted in nostalgia.  I, his oldest son, was just about the age he was when he first began building the Paper Tiger, and I think I had finally started to impress him with my woodworking capabilities.
  		<br><br>
  		He suggested I pick up where he left off.

		<p>By the spring of 2003, I was 14 years old and the initial concepts had begun to crystalize in my mind.  The Paper Tiger had been painted, rigged, and christened, and my dad and I had taken our maiden voyage.  The boat was a blast to sail.  It cut through the water with unparalleled precision and elegance. We had nailed the fluid dynamics.</p><br>
		<p class="collapse" id="block-id2">Having taught myself how to shape and fiberglass, I was now also the proud owner of my first surfboard.  I implemented my early fluid dynamics thinking into that design, but curving surfboards for performance wasn’t exactly revolutionary; it was standard practice.  Every surfer knows you don’t want the bottom of your board to be perfectly flat -- what a wasted opportunity that would be.  
		<br><br>
		I taught myself to paddle out and ride waves, and I fell completely in love with the ocean all over again.  What an amazing force.  What an incredible amount of energy.  Something to be loved and feared and respected at the same time.
		<br><br>
		I similarly revere my father, and at that early age I still expected him to have all the answers to the world's questions.  I asked him why no one cared about fluid dynamics and geometry in snow when it clearly mattered.  We talked about how he would always kick my butt when we raced down the mountain.  We acknowledged the mass differential, he was still heavier than me, but it didn’t matter: skiers were simply faster than snowboarders.  Turns out, “wetted surface length” and “wetted surface width” matter on snow too.  Snowboards were like fat little sailboats, and skis were like the Paper Tiger: long, narrow, and twin-hulled.  Most importantly, there was no observable reason for why snowboards had to be so limited.
		<br><br>
		That spring, for my 8th grade school project, I set out to build my first snowboard prototypes.
		<br><br>
		My father, once again, was my thought partner, and he was instrumental in thinking through the design challenges.  Snowboards, unlike surfboards and boats, need to be pressed as the fiberglass cures.  Before I could build the first fluid-dynamics inspired snowboard, I had to build a press.
		<br><br>
		I found two old doors in our basement, and by screwing blocks of wood into them in corresponding locations, I could force a plank of wood to bend into a snowboard shape by clamping the two doors together with the materials sandwiched in between.
		<br><br>
		I built the first two Gilson Snowboards that year.  I also built two flat snowboards as a control; it wouldn’t be fair to test my 14 year old capabilities against the biggest players in the industry and their Chinese manufacturing facilities.  I was building with wood and surfboard fiberglass, and they were building with high density plastics that were designed to hold wax and slide on snow.
		<br><br>
		I could tell you my first two prototypes worked, but I am as biased as they come and I am the only one who rode them, so I wouldn’t take my word for it anyway.
		<br><br>
		I now know the results were inconclusive, but it was clear that these early boards were unlike anything anyone had seen before.  They looked different and they felt different.  To me, it looked like I had shrunk the Paper Tiger and glued it to the bottom of a wooden snowboard.

		<p>I had done alright on my 8th grade project and somehow managed to sneak out of my middle school years.  Despite figuring out how to build the earliest prototypes, my 14-year-old mind was not equipped for what would be required next.  
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<p class="collapse" id="block-id3">The idea was cast to the backburner, although not for lack of effort.  I got laughed out of a patent lawyer’s office as a young teenager for assuming patents were free, and in my parents’ basement, I deconstructed industry standard snowboards and attempted to rebuild them with fluid-dynamics inspired designs.  This initiative ultimately came to a halt when I nearly set fire to my childhood home.  I was holding a stick of burning plastic as flaming balls of the material were uncontrollably flung over the sawdust-ridden floor.
		 <br><br>
		The design approach never left my mind, though, and at some point during my teenage years, I recall being stuck on a plane as a whole new set of realizations came flooding in.  I asked my neighbor for a pencil and paper and for the duration of the flight I ferociously drew blueprints and scribbled down notes about the potential designs and their corresponding benefits on snow.  I don’t remember his name or what he looked like, but at some point my neighbor, to whom the pencil and paper belonged, asked me what on earth I was doing.  I must have been a strange sight.  I paused and looked up, thinking about how I had no patent protection.  I couldn’t contain myself.  I told this perfect stranger that if he promised never to tell anyone, I would explain my thinking.  He laughed and agreed.  He was the first person outside my closest circle to know and understand this approach to snow design, although I doubt he appreciated its true potential.  I wonder where he is now.  I am thankful he kept his word.

		<p>By the summer of 2002, I was fully immersed in the Paper Tiger Project.  My father slipped back into an unbridled obsession with the endeavor, and I benefited from a highly engaged mentor.  Our free hours were spent together sanding, building, and fiberglassing.  My father taught me the importance of geometry and fluid dynamics as he allocated a painstaking amount of attention to every curvature and detail in the boat’s shape.</p>
		<p class="collapse" id="block-id4">During the days, I was struggling through middle school.  I loved math and science, but I couldn’t seem to learn as fast or in the same ways as the other students.  My mind would often drift to the workshop and to the Paper Tiger, and increasingly, to surfboards and snowboards.
		<br><br>
		I developed a fascination for boardsports and the lifestyles they evoked.  My grandmother on my mom’s side was a beautiful skier, and she passed that onto her kids and grandkids.  Thanks to my mom and grandmother, I had been on the mountain since I could walk, and thanks to my Dad, I had been coaxed into sailboats only a short while after that, but I had never known anyone who could surf waves.  I was completely mesmerized by the idea.
		<br><br>
		In an early lesson on the power of FedEx and the internet, I placed an order online from a wholesaler for a block of polystyrene foam, a roll of fiberglass, and a bucket of epoxy.  Next to the Paper Tiger, I started my own project.  I figured that if I could teach myself how to make a surfboard, I could learn to surf.  This turned out to be true.
		<br><br>
		While there was no Hollywood-style eureka moment, it was at this time, with all of these things on my mind, that our modern day design approach got its start.
		<br><br>
		I remember sitting in science class gazing at the scribbled chalk marks denoting H2O(solid) and H2O(liquid) on the board.  Our teacher was explaining phase changes, or something of the sort.  Although it is hard to be sure looking back so many years later, I believe it was in this moment that I made the initial connections between water and snow -- between sailboats, surfboards, and snowboards.
		<br><br>
		A question fixed itself in my mind: if snow and water are the same molecule in different states, why is there no attention given to geometry and fluid dynamics in snow, but so much attention in water?
		<br><br>
		Snow, especially softer snow, should act like a fluid when in motion, so why are snowboards and skis flat while every other moving object benefits from curvature?  Boats, planes, cars, submarines -- they are all carefully designed and carefully curved.  So are dolphins, fish, and birds, by the way.
